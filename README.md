# XCrack
## A tool for offline password attacks written in go
Hash cracking is one of the most essential things to do in cyber security. For that purpose I  created this password cracking tool with speeds comparable to other well known CPU based cracking tools such as John the ripper This tool uses a wordlist or brute force to crack a password hash. It has options for customized wordlist generation and wordlist merging, meaning you can combine 2 wordlists and create a new one while filtering out duplicateds. The app calculates the size of the wordlist
